I'm a certified Cross-culture manager from [hofstede insights](https://hi.hofstede-insights.com/certification-in-intercultural-management). I use to drop-by and compare how different countries do in their 6-dimentional culture model. The [free country comparison tool](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/product/compare-countries/) allows up to 4 countries to compare. I thought I need to dump their 'publically available' data into a sheet where researchers will find it more handy. I found they are already leaving [this json](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/wp-json/v1/country) file for the tool to use. I copied it, formatted it and kept it shared [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dc7NyH_oA42UaYzSQOaO2MV_XBeRcAJj):
