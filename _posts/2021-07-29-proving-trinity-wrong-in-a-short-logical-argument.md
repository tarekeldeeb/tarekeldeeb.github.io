Assume:
 - The father is God
 - The son is God

Then:
 - The father = the son in value, but a different person.
 
But the father enjoys the state of fatherhood, and should be equal to the son, this argument mandates that the son should have a grand son who's also an equal God. Repeating the same argument, the grandson should enjoy fatherhood. This series ends up with an âˆž number of equal deities. Consequently, having zero value in heaven!

If you are looking for a reasonable definition of God, have a look at [Islam in Brief](https://bridges-foundation.org/documentary/islam-in-brief) videos.
